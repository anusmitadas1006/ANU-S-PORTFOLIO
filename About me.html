    <div class="content">
        <p> I am a passionate and aspiring web designer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at Techno International Newtown. With a strong foundation in programming and design, I am dedicated to crafting visually appealing and user-friendly
            websites. I have a keen eye for aesthetics, usability, and modern web trends, and I am constantly learning new technologies to enhance my skills. My goal is to create engaging digital experiences that blend creativity with functionality, making
            the web more accessible and intuitive for users.</p>
        <p> As a BCA student, my approach to the web design process is a blend of creativity, technical proficiency, and user-centered thinking. I start by understanding the project requirements and target audience, ensuring that the design aligns with user
            needs and business goals. I focus on wireframing and prototyping to structure layouts effectively before moving on to coding with clean, responsive, and optimized designs. Leveraging my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and design principles,
            I prioritize aesthetics, functionality, and performance. I also believe in continuous learning and iteration, refining my designs based on feedback and the latest industry trends to create visually appealing and seamless web experiences.
